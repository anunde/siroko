# Siroko Cart API

Siroko is a brand that sells sports products, especially related to cycling and fitness, primarily through an e-commerce platform.

As part of the platform, we need to design a shopping cart that enables anyone interested in sports products to shop efficiently and quickly.

For this reason, the development team has decided that the best way to implement it is by starting with an API.
